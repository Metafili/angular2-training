# Exercise 1 - TODO List

Your first exercise is to implement a TODO list application with Angular 2

## 1.1 Basic Functionality

Implement a TODO list application with the following features for the user:
- Add new items
- Mark items done

Notes
- It's enough to save TODO items e.g. to an array. Rest API will be used later.

## 1.2 Service for TODO Items

- Implement a TodoService and inject it to your TODO list component
- Service can be used for saving, querying and modifying TODO items

## 1.3 Two-way Data Binding

- _Something with two-way binding? Button to change the case of an item?_

## 1.4 Pipes
- Add a date field to your TODO item
- Use a pipe to show the time when an item was added e.g. 14:31

## 1.5 Rest API
- Modify your TodoService to use the given Rest API
